### Welcome!
Project Xtended Project is a custom Android ROM based on **LineageOS** & **Lunaris-AOSP** .

We started Project Xtended not because we wanted to compete with other systems. We got tired. Tired of systems that were too complex, too heavy, too noisy.

### Codename: Anxiety
Project Xtended started out as a place of restlessness. We wanted a system that was light, quiet, and gave the user space‚Äînot one that weighed them down.

### Build Status: **Working on Progress** üèóÔ∏è
